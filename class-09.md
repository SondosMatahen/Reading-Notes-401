## express()
- Creates an Express application. The express() function is a top-level function exported by the express module.

## express.json([options])
- This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with JSON payloads and is based on body-parser.
- Returns middleware that only parses JSON and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option. 
- This parser accepts any Unicode encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

## express.Router([options])
- Creates a new router object.

## express.static(root, [options])
- This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It serves static files and is based on serve-static.

## express.urlencoded([options])
- This is a built-in middleware function in Express. It parses incoming requests with urlencoded payloads and is based on body-parser.
- Returns middleware that only parses urlencoded bodies and only looks at requests where the Content-Type header matches the type option.
- This parser accepts only UTF-8 encoding of the body and supports automatic inflation of gzip and deflate encodings.

## Middleware
- Middleware are functions which are passed control during execution of asynchronous functions. 
- Middleware is specified on the schema level and is useful for writing plugins.

## Types of Middleware
- document middleware
- model middleware
- aggregate middleware
- query middleware

## Use Cases
- complex validation
- removing dependent documents (removing a user removes all his blogposts)
- asynchronous defaults
- asynchronous tasks that a certain action triggers

## Subdocuments
- Subdocuments are documents embedded in other documents. In Mongoose, this means you can nest schemas in other schemas.
- Mongoose has two distinct notions of subdocuments: arrays of subdocuments and single nested subdocuments.

## What is a Subdocument?
Subdocuments are similar to normal documents. Nested schemas can have middleware, custom validation logic, virtuals, and any other feature top-level schemas can use. 

## Adding Subdocs to Arrays
- MongooseArray methods such as push, unshift, addToSet, and others cast arguments to their proper types transparently.

## Populate
- Population is the process of automatically replacing the specified paths in the document with document(s) from other collection(s).

## Setting Populated Fields
You can manually populate a property by setting it to a document.
