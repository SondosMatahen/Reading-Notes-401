>- Syn: Used to initiate and establish a connection. It also helps you to synchronize sequence numbers between devices.

>- ACK: Helps to confirm to the other side that it has received the SYN.

>- SYN-ACK: SYN message from local device and ACK of the earlier packet.

>- FIN: Used to terminate a connection.
