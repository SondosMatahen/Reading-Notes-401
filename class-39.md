## Redux Toolkit
- Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.
- Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.
- Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write "mutative" immutable update logic, and even create entire "slices" of state automatically.
- Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.

### Redux Reducer Bundles 
- The reducer/actions pair that ever needs their associated actions, it makes more sense for these pieces to be bundled together in an isolated module that is self contained, and can even be packaged easily into a library.

### MobX
- MobX is a simple, scalable and battle tested state management solution. This tutorial will teach you all the important concepts of MobX in ten minutes. 
- MobX is a standalone library, but most people are using it with React and this tutorial focuses on that combination.

### Hookstate
- Concise, pragmatic but flexible API. Very easy to learn. See Getting Started and other code samples to learn it in minutes.
- Incredible performance based on unique method for tracking of used/rendered and updated state segments. Ideal solution for huge states and very frequent updates.
- Small core library packed with features: global states, local states, asynchronously loaded states, partial state updates, deeply nested state updates
