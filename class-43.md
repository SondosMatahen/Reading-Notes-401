## CRA (create React App)
- it generates HTML code needed to render on the client side. So when you look at the source code before rendering, you can see itâ€™s basically few js files and an empty div. 
- These js files inject content into that div in the browser (Client-side rendering).

### Next.js
- supports server-side rendering. 
-  it means is that necessary HTML code is generated from the server itself, based on the URL.

### Javascript frameworks:
>- Node.js
>- React
>- AngularJS
