## Common Terminology:
- Node: it is the item that makes up the data structure.
- Root: The root is the top Node in the tree.
- Left Child: it is a node that is paced in the left of the root.
- Right Child: it is a node that is paced in the right of the root.
- Edge: it is the link between a parent and child node.
- Leaf: it is a node that does not contain any children.
- Height: it is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottom of the node.

## Traversals:
- it allows us to search for a node and print the contents of a tree.

## traversals categories"
- Depth First: it prioritize going through the height of the tree first.
>- Depth First methods:
>>- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
>>- In-order: left >> root >> right
>>- Post-order: left >> right >> root


- Breadth First: it iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.


## Binary Trees:
- Binary Trees restrict the number of children to twoÿ≤
- There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. 
- Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows.
