## Redux 
- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
- It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. 
- Redux is a state management tool.
- Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
- Centralizing your application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.
- Redux works with any UI layer, and has a large ecosystem of addons to fit your needs.
- The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed. 
- Redux's architecture lets you log changes, use "time-travel debugging", and even send complete error reports to a server.

### Why did I choose Jest as the testing framework?
- Jest was never considered and I was thinking of using either Mocha or Jasmine, as these were the two frameworks I was comfortable with as I have used them on projects related to AngularJS earlier.

### Good points about Jest:
>- easily setup and start testing.
>- Ability to run tests in parallel.
>- Snapshot testing.
>- Jest uses Jasmine for assertion
>- Code coverage is available right out of the box.
>- In-built Manual mocking
