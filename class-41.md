## React Native
- React Native is a JavaScript framework for writing real natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android.
- React Native also exposes JavaScript interfaces for platform APIs, so your React Native apps can access platform features like the phone camera, or the user's location.
- React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- With Expo tools, services, and React, you can build, deploy, and quickly iterate on native Android, iOS, and web apps from the same JavaScript codebase.

### ExpoKit
- ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init.
- Expo apps are written in pure JS and never "drop down" to the native iOS or Android layer.
