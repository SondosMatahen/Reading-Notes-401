## ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control.
- The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
- Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties.

### BENEFITS OF RBAC
>- Managing and auditing network access is essential to information security.
>- Access can and should be granted on a need-to-know basis.
>- With hundreds or thousands of employees, security is more easily maintained by limiting unnecessary access to sensitive information based on each userâ€™s established role within the organization.
