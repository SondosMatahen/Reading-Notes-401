## Routing:
- Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing.
- These routing methods specify a callback function called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method.
-In fact, the routing methods can have more than one callback function as arguments. With multiple callback functions, it is important to provide next as an argument to the callback function and then call next() within the body of the function to hand off control to the next callback.

## Express 4.00:
- Express 4.0 comes with the new Router. Router is like a mini express application. It doesn't bring in views or settings, but provides us with the routing APIs like .use, .get, .param, and route.
- We will house our routes in the server.js file.
- We'll only need one dependency, Express.

## Express Router:
- What exactly is the Express Router? It is a mini express application without all the bells and whistles of an express application, just the routing stuff. Let's take a look at exactly what this means. We'll go through each section of our site and use different features of the Router.

## Route methods
- A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

## Route paths
- Route paths define the endpoints at which requests can be made also Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

## Modularizing :
- Modularizing ensures that external functionality is created in such a way that it isn't dependent on other external functionality, a concept known as loose coupling.

## Route parameters
- Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL. The captured values are populated in the req.params object, with the name of the route parameter specified in the path as their respective keys.
