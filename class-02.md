## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
>- Writing the tests first requires you to really consider what do you want from the code.
>>- TDD creates a detailed specification.
>>>- TDD reduces time spent on rework.

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- in case we needed to test many times for a huge project.

## What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- if you want to do TDD properly you will have to fail a lot before you succeed.

## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
-  that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

## Name a use case for a static method
- when you want to provide class level access a method where the method should be callable without an instance of the class.

## Write an example of a Higher Order function and describe the use case it solves
>- sort, reduce, filter, forEach, map  are examples of Higher Order functions
>>- they are used to make code more general or flexible by parameterising behaviour.

# TERMS
- functional programming: designed to handle symbolic computation and list processing applications.
- pure function: accepts an input and returns a value without modifying any data outside its scope.
- higher-order function:a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
- immutable state: an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.
- object: containers for named values called properties or methods.
- object-oriented programming (OOP): a programming style which is associated with the concepts like class, object, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism.
- class:a special syntax for its prototypical inheritance model that is a comparable inheritance in class-based object oriented languages.
- prototype: an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript where function prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property is not visible.
- super:  keyword used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
- inheritance:  the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another.
- constructor: the object that owns the code.
- instance: the copy of the Reference that points to object at a point of time.
