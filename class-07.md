## Express:
- Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

## Express Middleware:
- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

## Express Routing:
- refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing, see Basic routing.
- These routing methods specify a callback function called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method.

## Test Pyramid:
The testing pyramid is a concept that helps you to balance your tests better. also, it delivers a graphical representation of a best-case test scenario.
