## React State (Links to an external site.)
- React components has a built-in state object.
- The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
- When the state object changes the component re-renders.

## Component Composition
- Routing is the process of keeping the browser URL in sync with what’s being rendered on the page. 
- React Router lets you handle routing declaratively & the react-router is a package provides the core routing functionality for React Router.
- All React components have a special children prop so that consumers can pass components directly by nesting them inside the jsx.
- This prop can be used by a tab content component to accept the actual content without needing to know anything else about it.

## What even is ‘children’?
- it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
