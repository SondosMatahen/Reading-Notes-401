# Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
- js allows you to write programs in JavaScript which can be run outside the browser. JavaScript is no longer just a browser scripting language. It's used for things it's not intended for, thus you hear about new frameworks being released everyday.

# What is the difference between a module and a package?
- A module is a single JavaScript file that has some reasonable functionality. A package is a directory with one or more modules inside of it and a package. json file which has metadata about the package. Now it's very common for people to refer to a package as a module.

# What does the node package manager do?
- Node Package Manager (NPM) is a command line tool that installs, updates or uninstalls Node. js packages in your application. It is also an online repository for open-source Node. js packages.

# Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module
- modules.exports = functionName()
- export function functionName(){return 'written code'}
- modules.exports = {firstFunction() , secondFunction() }


# What is NPM?
-npm is the world's largest Software Registry.

- The registry contains over 800,000 code packages.

- Open-source developers use npm to share software.

- Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.

ecosystem: a collection of software projects, which are developed and co-evolve in the same environment'
Node.js: is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
V8 Engine: V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. 
module:a module is a part of a program. Programs are composed of one or more independently developed modules that are not combined until the program is linked. A single module can contain one or several routines.
package: is a collection of programs that perform similar functions or have similar features.
node package manager (npm): npm is the world's largest Software Registry. The registry contains over 800,000 code packages. Open-source developers use npm to share software. Many organizations also use npm to manage private development.
server:is a type of software that is designed to be used, operated and managed on a computing server. It provides and facilitates the harnessing of underlying server computing power for use with an array of high-end computing services and functions.
environment:The state of a computer, usually determined by which programs are running and basic hardware and software characteristics.
interpreter:A JavaScript engine is a program or an interpreter which executes JavaScript code. A JavaScript engine can be implemented as a standard interpreter, or just-in-time compiler that compiles JavaScript to bytecode in some form.
compiler: The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute.
